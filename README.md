# MTA-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This is a analysis project for MTA data. The objectives are listed below.

1. Data analysis:
- Which station has the most number of units?
- What is the total number of entries & exits across the subway system for February 1, 2013?
- Letâ€™s define the busy-ness as sum of entry & exit count. What station was the busiest on February 1, 2013? What turnstile was the busiest on that date?
- What stations have seen the most usage growth/decline in 2013?
- What dates are the least busy? Could you identify days on which stations were not operating at full capacity or closed entirely?
- Bonus: What hour is the busiest for station CANAL ST in Q1 2013?
2. Visualization:
- Plot the daily row counts for data files in Q1 2013.
- Plot the daily total number of entries & exits across the system for Q1 2013.
- Plot the mean and standard deviation of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q1 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.
- Plot 25/50/75 percentile of the daily total number of entries & exits for each month in Q1 2013 for station 34 ST-PENN STA.
- Plot the daily number of closed stations and number of stations that were not operating at full capacity in Q1 2013.
